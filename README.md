# eventsourcingdb

The official Go client SDK for [EventSourcingDB](https://www.eventsourcingdb.io) â€“ a purpose-built database for event sourcing.

EventSourcingDB enables you to build and operate event-driven applications with native support for writing, reading, and observing events. This client SDK provides convenient access to its capabilities in Go.

For more information on EventSourcingDB, see its [official documentation](https://docs.eventsourcingdb.io/).

This client SDK includes support for [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to spin up EventSourcingDB instances in integration tests. For details, see [Using Testcontainers](#using-testcontainers).

## Getting Started

Import the package and create an instance by providing the URL of your EventSourcingDB instance and the API token to use:

```go
import (
  "net/url"

  "github.com/thenativeweb/eventsourcingdb-client-golang/eventsourcingdb"
)

// ...

baseUrl, err := url.Parse("http://localhost:3000")
if err != nil {
  // ...
}

apiToken := "secret"

client, err := eventsourcingdb.NewClient(baseUrl, apiToken)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

Then call the `Ping` function to check whether the instance is reachable. If it is not, the function will return an error:

```go
err := client.Ping()
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

*Note that `Ping` does not require authentication, so the call may succeed even if the API token is invalid.*

If you want to verify the API token, call `VerifyAPIToken`. If the token is invalid, the function will return an error:

```go
err := client.VerifyAPIToken()
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```
